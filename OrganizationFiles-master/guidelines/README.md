# General Policies

## Office Hours

In France an academic job comes with the same benefits and rules than any work contract: social security, eligibility to unemployment benefits, but also office hours. Office hours are flexible, however to encourage lab interaction, try to be in during 'peak' hours -- e.g., between 10am and 5pm. Please also do your best to attend to the Monday [EPS seminar](https://imag.edu.umontpellier.fr/seminaires/seminaires-eps/) and let your supervisor know if you cannot. It is also a good idea to attend to other meetings whenever possible to help you think of broader impacts of your current work. Keep in mind that being in a lab is a good way of learning from others, helping others, building camaraderie, having fast and easy access to resources (and people) you need.

P.I.s sometimes work at night and during the weekends. This means that you might sometimes receive emails or instant messages outside of normal working hours. We do not expect you to respond until you are back at work (you can ignore them, and you're welcome to systematically filter out professional messages on your preferred device outside working hours). We do not expect cases when we suddenly and urgently need something from you over the weekend (e.g., for a grant deadline or last minute talk preparation), but should we anticipate that happening, we will bring it up in advance so we can plan accordingly. All this said, we realize that being told you can ignore messages might not take away the stress of seeing messages if you check work email or instant messaging system in the evenings or on weekends. If our off-hours messages are unwelcome and cause distress, please talk to us, and we will be better at not bothering you during your time off.
Holidays

We are lucky in France to have a fair amount of holidays, so enjoy it! If you are a post-doc, Phd student or engineer you MUST take them before the end of your contract. Taking days off on a regular basis is important. It helps you to step back from work and in the end be more creative and productive. Taking holidays after deadlines is good, as rushes before deadlines are generally tiring and stressful. It is recommended to anticipate your days off (let's say at least a week before), although it is possible to do it at the last minute a day before if needed.

Last but not least, in case you cannot be in your office for a full day (because you are sick, on a business trip, etc.), please inform your P.I. as soon as possible that you will be absent.

# Communication and Individual Meetings

You'll find that my door is closed only when I am not in the office or I have an in-person or phone meeting. Whenever the door is open, please feel free to come in and ask brief questions or give quick updates. I will always have time for a spontaneous very brief discussion. If it's not a good time for a longer chat, I'll let you know. Just ask or write me to schedule time to discuss something that requires more time or thought.

You may text me directly (e.g. with Slack of Google Hangouts) with questions or comments that I would be able to answer quickly with a few words. During working hours, you can expect a quick response most of the time (whether they I am in office or not). When working with some member of the team you are also encouraged to use the #general slack channel to reach the entire group, or of course another group member directly, when appropriate. Anything that requires deeper thought or a longer discussion should be an e-mail or in-person meeting instead.

You should meet me for an extended individual discussion on a regular basis.

# Research (mostly applies to PhD students)

Importantly, you should expect to be continually reading papers to stay up-to-date in the field and acquire broader scientific knowledge. Reading one paper a week is considered good practice, but you probably need to read more in the first months working on a new topic. This will be an entirely independent activity that you are expected to perform on your own. I may suggest particularly relevant papers when I come across them, but otherwise you should find and choose which papers to read independently. With time, reading good papers will also help you improve your own writing.
Resources for that could be [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), [The arXivist](http://arxivist.com/), [Scholar Google](https://scholar.google.fr/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), etc.
Online data bases for bib files of interests are [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), [mathscinet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html), [Zentralblatt MATH](https://zbmath.org/) among others.


In developing your PhD proposal, you agreed on certain topics and objectives to reach. These are not written in stone and can be amended with mutual agreement. Notably, as you become more experienced, you will develop several new ideas. Of course, it may be possible for you to develop a new idea into a full component of your thesis.

# Conferences

You will identify me conferences that make sense for you to attend, but if you come across an interesting conference or workshop that you would like to attend, simply ask. If the budget allows, you will typically get one "free ride" at the beginning of your PhD with no accepted paper or abstract, but then you have to get some work accepted to travel.

# Deadline management

You will have deadlines and you should anticipate them. Deadlines for NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, etc. or any other conference are known months in advance. So when submitting to a conference do not wait till the last minute to share the paper with me. It is likely that more than one paper is in the loop and I need many hours to help with writing and figure improvements. You are expected to send me one week before the deadline a full paper that can be realistically improved within one week. Of course, you are welcome to share the figures and results earlier than one week before the deadline.

# Difficulties?

In the event of friction or conflict with another colleague, whatever nature, you are welcome to discuss it with me or other permanent team members. This includes any difficulties within the group, or with external collaborators.

In case you feel a conflict developing, with any of us or anyone you're expected to work with, schedule a meeting to discuss it with your P.I. or another a permanent team member. If this option is not appropriate, the university human resources (https://www.umontpellier.fr/universite/directions/direction-des-ressources-humaines) can provide advice, including directing you to confidential resources.

# Communication

We are mostly communicating using Slack http://salmonlab.slack.com and Mattermost https://mattermost.math.cnrs.fr/salmonlab/channels/general its open source alternative in the group.
For visio-conferences you can use https://rendez-vous.renater.fr/ or https://meet.jit.si/.


# TeX / LaTeX

TeX / LaTeX is mandatory when writing research in Mathematics, Computer Science or signal processing. A full [TeX / LaTeX section](../tex/README.md) is dedicated here.
Among the useful tools a modern editor, say one that can handle **snippet** or multi-cursors, is recommended (like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
On top of that useful tools connected to LaTeX include:

- https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ : to create LaTeX tables from copy/paste values or .csv files
- Inkscape (see for more information in the [Inkscape](../inkscape/README.md) section): useful for sketching figures with, especially with the [TexText](https://inkscape.org/~jcwinkler/%E2%98%85textext) extension.


# Coding (with Python or not)
