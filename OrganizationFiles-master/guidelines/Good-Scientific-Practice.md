# Good scientific writing / presenting practices

## Poster

You can use Tex/Latex (see for instance [poster.tex](../tex/draft-poster/poster.tex)).
Yet, another option is [Better Scientific Poster](https://osf.io/ef53g/).

## Reproducible research

- [Vers une recherche reproductible](https://rr-france.github.io/bookrr/) (in French).

## Images

1. Use images that you created whenever you can.

2. If you don't know how to create a figure (though in most cases [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) should be enough), borrow it and cite the source appropriately. Favor CreativeCommons images, see for instance resources at
https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/
