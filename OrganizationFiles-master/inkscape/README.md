# Inkscape

Inkscape is full of joy!
Below are some interesting patterns you can create, and some help on how to learn to master Inkscape with it.

- [Repeat an Object Around a Shape with Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jve45Z60iU)
to get something like
[pattern_along_path.svg](images/pattern_along_path.svg) <p float="left"> <img src="images/pattern_along_path.svg?sanitize=true" width="300">

    **Challenge**: can you replicate this https://ssdesai.wordpress.com/2020/06/30/mandala/ in Inkscape?

- How to convert a .png to .svg  file with Inkscape:
this use case is particularly helpful if you need to create (and guess what you do!) a numeric **signature** from a scanned version:

see also https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/tracing/tutorial-tracing.html.

    Example:
    [IMAG.png](images/IMAG.svg) vs.[IMAG.svg](images/IMAG.svg)
    <p float="left"><img src="images/IMAG.png?sanitize=true" width="300">
    <img src="images/IMAG.svg?sanitize=true" width="300">
